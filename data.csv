Many still do not understand difference between dry and wet waste. This is mainly because of lack of knowledge. I do not see BBMP putting much effort in making people understand the what is dry and wet waste. Also, why it is needed and what are the advantages of segregation. WhatsApp can be used as a media for such education. Next is using digital technology to the most for tracking waste and wardwise schedule of collection, launching a mobile app for all activities related to waste collection. I think mobile app can also have education content about waste. The overall process of waste collection and segregation has to be public friendly than a burden. Think from people's point of view.

Sir,

This is to bring to your attention the CONTINUED inaction of the authorities to curb illegal and dangerous activities in Bangalore in spite of several requests from residents.

 In BBMP Ward 111, Shantala Nagar coming under purview of MLA N A Haris an illegal food cart vendor has set up shop with the backing of local hoteliers on the pavement at the corner of DeSouza Road and Hayes Road (which connects Residency Road and Richmond Road). Desouza Road is a narrow residential street
 Such activity is illegal and needs to be stopped. The illegal stall has also attracted criminal elements peddling drugs and liquor and sex to customers.
 He is obstructing the right of way of pedestrians and polluting the air, road and storm water drains.
 He is using open fire and gas cylinders in the open in close proximity to electric junction boxes, street lights and transformers and fuel tanks of parked vehicles.
 The said vendor also dumps used inflammable oil, waste and other refuse on the road, pavements and storm water drains.
 The surrounding area has turned into an eyesore
 There is now also a rise in number of mosquitoes, flies, rats, dogs due to this

The vendors blocking the pavement on Desouza Road and Hayes Road need to be removed. The footpath is not an area for vendors but it is to be provided for pedestrians.

Desouza Road has as a result become an eyesore in the centre of Bangalore.
Photographic evidence is attached to this email.

Kindly do inspect the area for yourself and get the concerned authorities to act immediately.

Also, there is no action by conductors or drivers against such behaviour.

BMTC being public transport seats are available to customers on first come first serve basis except for physically challenged or senior citizens.

In a same incident today, a lady kept bag on seat when i was just about to sit (Please not i was not even far from the seat) and then started arguing with me to vacate the seat since she kept her bag their and has been travelling on that route since 25 years and the bus belongs to her father(Yes she said this). It was not only argument but she also physically started fighting with me. 

And the conductor and driver instead of asking her to get down or imposing fine on her asked me only to move. I have no problem in shifting to different seat and I understand it was not driver or conductor who started the fight, but this is general rule that there are no reservations in BMTC unlike KSRTC and conductor and driver being representative of BMTC services are responsible to maintain order.

Many times it is noticed that conductor and driver dont come forward to see who is actually wrong even in cases when a senior citizen is standing and while a young person is sitting in seats reserved for them.

The bus was for route ""Singapura - Vidhana Soudha"" 271c at 8:30 am on 24.1.19.

I want to draw your attention towards the water logging problem besides our apartment wall possibly due to water leakage from unknown source.  As there is no passage for the water to flow out of the plots water logging is creating a heaven for the mosquitos, snakes and other insects in the nereby areas including our apartment. There is high possibility of dengue and malaria. Kids, parents and elders are already witnessing problems by this.and there is no stopping yet. 
Sir kindly look into the matter and direct the concerned officials to take necessary action as soon as possible. Attached is the picture for your reference.

At Castle street, Tate Lane, Wood street, which is the city business district  wherein people park the car and leave the car for months even years. Moreover people who park do not even live closeby, they live elsewhere and park at prime locations making it immensely difficult or even impossible for people who live and work on that road to find parking hence parking on the roadside thereby adding to the traffic woes and reducing the vehicle carriageway. If there is a rotation of parking, there will be movement.We would like to indicate that our road has cars parked for a very long duration and collected a thick layer of dust,leaves,etc . To avoid the dust now they have also covered their car with the cover and left their cars for eternity. These cars have not even moved an inch for a really long time some for a few years.  We have also observed people park their cars here and not close to their residence which would be located quite far. The parking needs to be done at their residences and not out here where commercial establishments find it virtually impossible to find parking. Another nexus is of the owner/shopkeepers who pre book the spaces infront of their shops/establishment with a chain, watchman, stones, parked car which are public land ;like Fawwaz Perfume, Wecool Imports, Studio Plus store, Double Decker Restaurant for their personal parking even though it is public parking, though we would want to know how this can be avoided or acted upon. The police would have to act on this to curb such acts.We would really like a change to happen either in the form of paid parking or deliberately remove cars which have been parked for a long duration of time which will definitely remove all these long term parking and thereby reducing traffic woos. Another problem is the building getting constructed have all the debris & material put out eventually blocking a few more car parks, if they clear this - it would also help in parking a few cars.

This is one of the most happening issues at Kumara Park West,nehru Nagar triangular park.

This is to get to your notice that this park has been devoid of it's rights by utilising this as a restaurant by an illegal stand away and take away restaurant Ammas canteen at seshadripuram-Kp west .

This has been got to notice of several local authorities but in vain,the recalcitrant administrators from bbmp/Local police station authority chose to play the cards close to there chest.I forsee a huge amount of bribes which is accepted by the local authority .

This restaurant has damaged the local beauty of the locality,the left over plates are thrown in the triangular park and uilising this as an open air restaurant.

The restaurant needs to be locked out which will solve several difficulties faced by the residents currently-The vehicles are parked in the no Parking zones ,and the restaurant has encouraged to park there vehicles in the tow away zone making it extremely difficult to the local residents to park there own vehicles or taking it away for there own use.

The triangular park needs to be locked and a security should be deployed to ensure compliance and deligence of the nuisance which is occurring on a regular basis.

The park needs to be maintained and the restaurant the take aways Should be locked out by the authorities which should be a breath free for the local residents .

---The eatery should be closed on a permanent basis,with reference to the law passed by the government for the closure of illegal business in the Residential areas.

---The park needs to get a face lift and a locked feature and a security  so that the regular clients will never get to the park and utilise it to chair to there own needs of the day.

We must live healthy life here in Bangalore.
Air pollution is big take on above point.

What can be done?
Solution:
As our BBMP commissioner rightly pointing out, if vehicles goes 10% every year what ever you build roads will never enough.

From this we can understand we must encourage people to use public transportation, why people are preferring to use personal vehicles instead of public transportation? Don't we have proper connectivity? Please check with the them , we can able to answer to all of them.

Things to follow to see Bangalore as clean City.
1. Create an imaginable understanding on usage of public transportation and to avoid air pollution , first in school , colleges, software office.

2. Advertise a short film on this.
3. The last mile connectivity can be done by walk to avoid future diabetes.
4. Please feel free to reach out to me or like minded students on pollution , so they can give all ideas for creating awareness.

We are uneducated literates, thats all the problem is.

How come this ticket is closed with fixing the Street lights: W01920C448748 

There are no Street lights for more than a Half Kilometer and walking in that road after 6pm (Evening) has become very dangerous. 

No Lights, Pitch Dark and it's very dangerous. I spoke to BBMP and they say Panchayat is responsible for that and when I check with Panchayat, they said BBMP. 

Recently there was a Major accident in the evening and it has become very dangerous now. That Person lost his Leg in the Accident. Its the road which goes from Pragathi Nagar, Electronic City to Chikkathogur (Velankani). 

There was even a Murder in recent times. 

Need Street Lights to be Fixed ASAP before something major disaster happens again.

It's also pitch dark in the evenings and there are no lights on that road too. Lot of people take this road and it's very unsafe too.
As the road is bad with a big pithole there is water logging in the place too.
Vehicles taking the road don't even bother to go slowly even though they are so bumpy. There are also accidents that happen due to the  bad road.
Water logging in the pothole causes splash on the other vehicles and pedestrians and this  causes lot of nuisance.

Request you to kindly look into the same at the earliest and make  our roads more safer.

And later once the token is allotted, the next date will be given, in order to create or update Aadhaar, and again same thing happens, like early morning in terrible cold, standing in queues. Which I don't feel it as good.

Suggestion : let the appointment slots be booked online, let the applicant submit his details, fix the appointment date and time, on which he wants to update/create Aadhaar. Based on the submitted details, let the Kendras/booths be diviided like which Kendra will do the updates, and the other set of Kendras should take care of creating new Aadhars. 
And let the user, print his acknowledgement, and ask the user to be present on scheduled appointed date and time.

And let the appointments be scheduled in time slot basis. Like if I book an appointment on 1st March 2019 9:00 AM, at XYZ Aadhar Kendra, the same time slot shouldn't be given to other applicants in this Kendra.

Being a new resident to this area I am really unhappy with the maintenance and the caring towards the society and people. So i request the government for tarring of the road at the earliest and take the necessary action.

Unfortunately, there is no alternative roads towards Marathahalli  apart from just outer ring road and Doddakannelli-Kadubesnahalli Road. Hence, all the traffic on Sarjapura road is distributed on both the streches and causing huge pile up of traffic on this road. The road is unscientific as it is does not have uniform consistent width. To add to woes, there is no lane discipline and which makes narrow width stretches as bottle necks before the junction.

Most of the times these days, it takes about 45 mins to 1 hour to just cross the AET junction from Andhra Bank, Doddakannelli (~2 KMs of stretch). Due to this , there is a huge loss in fuel and precious time.

As a short term solution, I believe BBMP and Bangalore traffic police should think of alternatives to de congest the AET junction and should think of laying parallel roads to outer ring road as a long term solution. However, it is upto agencies to think of best solution for benefit of citizens and city.

Kindly look into this matter as people tend to leave garbage infront of houses unattended waiting for garbage collectors to pick up but they dont seem to pick it up if just left outside. They do this for want of tips to handle such unattended garbage. Moreover the dogs and cats mess up the unattended garbage bags leading to mess all over and unhygienic surroundings.

Before few months back, the u-turn in our road end is blocked by the highway devider but within 3 days the people one who have influence have removed for their business purposes.
We really need piece for us and many aged and small children are their in the road
Each and everyone are suffering due to this vehicles issues.

We are facing many problems in this area and no one is caring about the complaints for this area.

1. More people will go by rickshaws rather than getting bikes and cars or bus
2. This inturn will provide more earnings to drivers
3. Busses will be less loaded/crowded as lot of the people can afford richshaws and currently are just not travelling due to rickshaw drivers demanding insanse amounts

With the illegal construction allowed on the CA site, due to prohibited heavy vehicles moving on the road in a residential area, frequent digging up of road by BSNL and GAIL gas to lay pipeline the tar has wear out. 

This has caused dust to settle in the houses due to vehicle movement. 

While all the adjacent roads were tarred a year back this road was left out.

Do the necessary to fix the worn out road.
